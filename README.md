## ✏️ Customization

Make this portfolio your own by modifying these files:

### 1. Update Personal Info & Links (`portfolio.html`)
*   Change the profile names, titles, and descriptions inside sections: `<section id="home">`, `<section id="about">`, and `<section id="education">`.
*   Replace contact URLs under `<div class="contact-grid">` with your own profile links.

### 2. Update Profile Image
*   Replace `profile.jpeg` with your own image, keeping the filename identical, or edit the source path in:
    ```html
    <img src="profile.jpeg" alt="Pulipati Rahul">
    ```

### 3. Edit Typing Roles (`javascript.js`)
Modify the `roles` array at the top of `javascript.js` to change the roles printed out in the typing animation:
```javascript
const roles = [
    "Full Stack Developer",
    "Web Developer",
    "Frontend Developer",
    "Problem Solver",
    "Digital Marketing Enthusiast"
];
```
